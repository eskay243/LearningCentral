## Test Coverage Summary

| Feature Area | Test Coverage | Status |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Authentication | 90% | ✅ Passing |
| Dashboard | 70% | ⚠️ Partial |
| Course Management | 60% | ⚠️ Partial |
| Assessment System | 40% | ❌ Needs Work |
| Live Sessions | 20% | ❌ Needs Work |
| Payment Processing | 10% | ❌ Needs Work |

## Conclusion

The mentor account system has a solid foundation with working authentication and basic dashboard functionality. However, critical database schema issues and incomplete feature implementations require immediate attention before the system can be considered production-ready.

The Assessment & Grading system implementation is a major achievement, but integration testing reveals several areas needing refinement. The live session and payment processing features require comprehensive testing and debugging.

**Recommended Timeline**: 2-3 additional development cycles to address critical issues and complete comprehensive testing of all mentor functionality.
