## Current Challenges Summary
Based on our conversation and the terminal command history, here are the main challenges encountered:

### 1. Database Migration Issues
- Empty Database : The PostgreSQL database was initially empty despite migration files existing
- Missing Migration Tools : drizzle-kit was not available in the Docker container environment
- Manual Migration Required : Had to manually execute SQL migration files using psql commands
### 2. PowerShell Compatibility Issues
- Redirection Operator : PowerShell doesn't support the < redirection operator used in Unix-style commands
- Command Syntax : Required alternative approaches like Get-Content | psql or psql -f flag
### 3. Production Deployment Challenges
- Hostname Resolution : production-host placeholder couldn't be resolved to an actual IP address
- Configuration Gaps : Need to replace placeholder values with actual production server details
- Environment Setup : Production environment variables and database connections need proper configuration
### 4. Authentication & User Management
- Empty User Database : No pre-existing users in the system
- OAuth Dependency : System relies on OAuth authentication for user creation
- Admin Setup Process : Requires manual admin privilege assignment through /admin-setup endpoint
### 5. Development vs Production Gap
- Environment Configuration : `.env.production` needs actual production values
- Database Import Process : Need proper procedures for importing data to production
- SSL/Domain Setup : Production deployment requires proper domain and SSL configuration
### 6. Technical Debt
- Multiple Cookie Files : Numerous test cookie files suggest extensive debugging sessions
- Backup Management : `backup.sql` exists but import process faced technical hurdles
- Documentation Scattered : Multiple deployment guides and reports indicate complex setup requirements
### Immediate Action Items
1. Configure actual production database hostname/IP
2. Set up proper environment variables for production
3. Establish reliable database migration workflow
4. Create initial admin user through OAuth + admin setup process
5. Streamline deployment process with proper automation
### Root Cause
Most challenges stem from the transition from development to production environment, where placeholder configurations need to be replaced with actual production values and proper deployment procedures need to be established.
