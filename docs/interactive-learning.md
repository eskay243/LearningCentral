# Interactive Learning Environment

## Overview
The interactive learning environment is a key component of the Codelab Educare LMS, offering a Codecademy-like experience for coding exercises. The system allows students to practice coding skills directly within the platform through an interactive code editor.

## Features

### Current Implementation
- **Monaco Editor Integration**: Rich code editing experience with syntax highlighting and code completion
- **Exercise Management**: CRUD operations for coding exercises with difficulty levels
- **Progress Tracking**: Ability to track student progress across all exercises
- **Testing Framework**: Built-in test validation for code exercises
- **Hint System**: Progressive hints to help students when they get stuck

### Database Schema
- `coding_exercises`: Stores exercise details (title, description, instructions, initial code, solution, etc.)
- `exercise_progress`: Tracks student progress for each exercise (status, completion, time spent, etc.)

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/coding-exercises`: Get all exercises (filtered by course, module, or lesson)
- `GET /api/coding-exercises/:id`: Get a specific exercise
- `POST /api/coding-exercises`: Create a new exercise
- `PUT /api/coding-exercises/:id`: Update an existing exercise
- `GET /api/coding-exercises/:id/progress`: Get progress for a specific exercise
- `POST /api/coding-exercises/:id/progress`: Update progress for a specific exercise
- `GET /api/users/:userId/exercise-progress`: Get all exercise progress for a user

## Future Enhancements
- **Secure Code Execution**: Server-side code execution with sandboxing
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Allow mentors to collaborate with students on exercises
- **Code Playgrounds**: Language-specific environments for different programming languages
- **Automated Feedback**: AI-powered suggestions for code improvements
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Step-by-step interactive tutorials for different programming concepts
- **Badge System**: Award badges for completing sets of exercises
- **Export/Import**: Allow exporting exercises between courses

## Related Components
- **Course Management**: Exercises can be linked to specific courses, modules, and lessons
- **Assessment System**: Exercises complement the quiz/assessment system
- **Analytics**: Exercise completion contributes to student performance analytics

## Implementation Notes
- The EnhancedCodeEditor component provides the core editor experience
- Progress is saved incrementally as students work through exercises
- Exercise difficulty levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced
- Supported languages: JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS (expandable)
