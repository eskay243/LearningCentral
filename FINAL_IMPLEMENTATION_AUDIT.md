## ‚ö†Ô∏è IDENTIFIED IMPLEMENTATION GAPS

### 1. Storage Layer Inconsistencies (High Priority)
**Issue**: DatabaseStorage class has TypeScript errors and missing method implementations
- 194 LSP diagnostics in `server/storage.ts`
- Methods like `getQuiz()` are missing from storage interface
- Database adapter migration incomplete from node-postgres to neon-serverless

**Impact**: Some quiz and assessment features may fail with database connection
**Fix Required**: Complete DatabaseStorage implementation and resolve TypeScript errors

### 2. Admin User Management Page (Medium Priority)
**Issue**: No dedicated admin user management interface
- Users can be managed but no centralized admin UI
- Individual user editing available but bulk operations missing

**Current Workaround**: User management via individual profile pages and role assignment
**Fix Required**: Create dedicated `/admin/users` management interface

### 3. Video Conferencing Integration (Low Priority)
**Issue**: WebRTC framework present but specific video provider integration incomplete
- Live session schema and management complete
- Video provider settings UI available
- Actual video conferencing needs provider-specific implementation

**Current Status**: Sessions can be scheduled and managed, external video links can be used
**Fix Required**: Complete Google Meet/Zoom integration or implement WebRTC video calls

### 4. Database Connection Restoration (Database Infrastructure)
**Issue**: Neon PostgreSQL endpoint disabled
- System running on memory storage fallback
- All functionality working but data not persistent
- Database schema ready for deployment

**Current Status**: Fully operational with memory storage
**Fix Required**: Reactivate Neon endpoint and run `npm run db:push`
