## ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUES TO ADDRESS

### TypeScript Errors (High Priority)
- 🔴 Property access errors in Dashboard component (mentorEarnings properties)
- 🔴 Course object type checking in CourseView (mentorId, title properties)
- 🔴 Multiple storage.ts Drizzle ORM type mismatches
- 🔴 Assessment quiz attempts table missing (causing backend errors)

### Database Schema Issues
- 🔴 Missing assessment_quiz_attempts table causing relation errors
- 🔴 Discussion system schema conflicts (duplicate CourseDiscussion types)
- 🔴 Some certificate template operations need database migration

### Backend API Issues
- 🔴 Course discussions API endpoints not implemented (404 errors expected)
- 🔴 Quiz attempts functionality incomplete due to missing table
- 🔴 Some mentor earnings calculations return empty objects

## 📋 REMAINING TASKS

### Critical Priority (Next Session)
1. **Implement course discussion API endpoints** (POST/GET for discussions)
2. **Fix TypeScript property access errors** in Dashboard and CourseView
3. **Create missing assessment_quiz_attempts table** 
4. **Resolve schema conflicts** in discussion system

### High Priority
5. **Complete mentor earnings calculations** (currently returning empty objects)
6. **Implement KYC verification workflow** 
7. **Add course completion tracking** with progress updates
8. **Certificate generation automation** on course completion

### Medium Priority
9. **Performance optimization** for dashboard queries
10. **Live session management** with WebRTC integration
11. **Mobile responsiveness** improvements
12. **Advanced analytics** and reporting features

### Low Priority
13. **User documentation** and help guides
14. **Admin documentation** for system management
15. **API documentation** for developers
16. **Backup and recovery** procedures

## 🎯 NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

1. **Implement discussion API endpoints** to support the new threaded system
2. **Fix TypeScript errors** preventing clean compilation
3. **Create missing database tables** for quiz attempts
4. **Test course discussion functionality** end-to-end
